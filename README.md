I used the VS Code for writing the code and deployed the site with GitHub Pages.
Few things I learnt here are :
* Before you start with the coding, you must have an outline of how the final site may look like.
* Take a course before building the site. Although, you can also do it along with the course.
* In CSS use ids and classes as much as you can. Do it even if it is not required. It will decrease the chances of future confusion. Also, it will be easier to add new features.
