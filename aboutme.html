    <p>
        I was born in a small town of Barauni. Currently, I am studying Electrical Engineering at  IIT Kanpur. 
        I am learning a lot of interesting and cool things here.<br>
         In the beginning, I  joined the Electronics Club, and now I am a secretary here. Also, I attended winter camp in Programming Club and 
        Electronics Club. I was introduced to a plethora of topics there. <br>
        In Electronics I learnt about IoT, analog and digital circuits, microcontrollers and Image Processing.<br>
         In Programming Club, I learnt about 
        Machine Learning, Cryptography, Web Development, Competitive Programming and CTF.<br>
        I love coding and have participated in many Competitive Programming contests at Codeforces and Codechef.
        My interest in Mathematics is also increasing day by day. Currently, I am learning Machine Learning and 
        Web Development.
